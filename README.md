# Project: Neighboring Communities

This is the code for manipulating .shp files that contain the geometry of a certain object and the end result is finding the neighboring objects. In addition to that, the "best neighbor" of each object is also provided with "best neighbor" being the object that shares the most boarder length.

To analyse some actual data the official shape file provided from the Hellenic Statistic Authority is used and more specifically the municipal communities.
